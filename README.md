# Open Source AI Research

## Mission Statement

Open source AI research and engineering should reach the frontier during 2026.

## Vision

The future of artificial intelligence should be shaped by the global community, not controlled by a select few organizations. It belongs in the open, accessible to researchers, engineers, and innovators worldwide.

## The Challenge

For years, proprietary companies advance rapidly in areas like reasoning systems, synthetic data generation, and self-improving AI architectures, the open source community has been left to reverse-engineer breakthroughs or wait for limited disclosures, which is often denied.

This dependency is unnecessary. Research innovation doesn't require the massive compute resources that product deployment does. The gap exists not due to technical limitations, but due to artificial scarcity of knowledge sharing.

## Our Commitment

**Target Date: August, 2026**

We must close the research gap between proprietary and open source AI development, and we should try our best to do it within one year. This initiative will focus on:

- Collaborative research
- Open & available knowledge
- Independent innovation & contributions
- Community-driven progress

## Practical Projects

My approach combines theoretical advancement with hands-on learning:

- Language Models
- Image and Video Diffusion
- Hybrid Architectures: Novel combinations and architectures

There is 1000x to 10000x more image data than text, and 1000x to 10000x more video data than images that AI systems have yet to fully utilize.

## Invitation to Collaborate

Contributions are welcomes and encouraged:
- Academic researchers seeking to maximize impact
- Industry professionals committed to open science
- Students and beginners eager to learn and contribute
- Anyone passionate about democratizing AI research

## Principles

1. **Collaborative Development**: Progress through community effort rather than individual gatekeeping
2. **Practical Focus**: Real projects that teach and advance the field
3. **Inclusive Growth**: Supporting contributors at all skill levels
4. **Commercial Compatibility**: Open research that enables innovation while allowing companies to build profitable products

## Call to Action

The scientific community has the talent, dedication, and collective resources to match any proprietary research effort. Future of humanity will not be sold through an API but it will be available and shaped by everybody.

Join me in making 2026 the year open source AI research reaches the frontier.
