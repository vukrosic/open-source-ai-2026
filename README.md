## 🔬 Let's Research Together

You can become a top 0.1% AI researcher & engineer while creating new knowledge that benefits everyone.

These are projects I'm working on that I believe are the next big things that will accelerate AI progress.
I am recording step by step video series for each of them.

### Projects

Traditional language models process text through tokens, but the future lies in working directly with raw bytes.

**Project**: Bitstream Foundation Models Research

More coming soon...

Follow along through [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XJj9pv_11a11FUxCMz15g) where you can fork, experiment, and contribute to pushing open source AI to the frontier.

## 🌍 Vision

The future of artificial intelligence should be shaped by the global community. It belongs in the open, accessible to researchers, engineers, and innovators worldwide.

## ⚡ The Challenge

For years, proprietary companies advance rapidly in areas like reasoning systems, synthetic data generation, and self-improving AI architectures, the open source community has been left to reverse-engineer breakthroughs or wait for limited disclosures, which is often denied.

This dependency is unnecessary. Research innovation doesn't require the massive compute resources that product deployment does. The gap exists not due to technical limitations, but due to artificial scarcity of knowledge sharing.

## 💪 Our Commitment

**Target Date: August, 2026**

We must close the research gap between proprietary and open source AI development, and we should try our best to do it within one year. This initiative will focus on:

- 🤝 Collaborative research
- 📖 Open & available knowledge
- 💡 Independent innovation & contributions
- 🌟 Community-driven progress

## 🛠️ Practical Projects

My approach combines theoretical advancement with hands-on learning:

- 🧠 Language Models
- 🎨 Image and Video Diffusion
- 🔗 Hybrid Architectures: Novel combinations and architectures

There is 1000x to 10000x more image data than text, and 1000x to 10000x more video data than images that AI systems have yet to fully utilize.

## 🤗 Invitation to Collaborate

Contributions are welcomes and encouraged:
- 🎓 Academic researchers seeking to maximize impact
- 💼 Industry professionals committed to open science
- 📚 Students and beginners eager to learn and contribute
- ❤️ Anyone passionate about democratizing AI research

## ⚖️ Principles

1. **Collaborative Development**: Progress through community effort rather than individual gatekeeping
2. **Practical Focus**: Real projects that teach and advance the field
3. **Inclusive Growth**: Supporting contributors at all skill levels
4. **Commercial Compatibility**: Open research that enables innovation while allowing companies to build profitable products

## 📢 Call to Action

The scientific community has the talent, dedication, and collective resources to match any proprietary research effort. Future of humanity will not be sold through an API but it will be available and shaped by everybody.

Join me in making 2026 the year open source AI research reaches the frontier.

*This initiative is built on the principle that the best science emerges from collaboration, transparency, and shared knowledge. I invite all researchers and organizations to contribute to this vision of open AI development.*
